# Smart-Automated-Hydroponics-Systrem
This project is a smart hydroponics automation system powered by an ESP32 DevKit v1. It monitors temperature, humidity, pH, water level, and nutrient tank temperature, and provides real-time data logging to Firebase Realtime Database. It also sends alerts via Telegram Bot and controls water flow and nutrient dosing using servo and relay modules.
